## Description

Corey Schafer (on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5)) is a YouTube  channel host, whose straightforward and detailed approach has been incredibly helpful.

Tutorials range in subject but tend to be written in Python. He often dives deeply into subjects in extensive playlists.

Basic code is not original except where otherwise noted. The point is just to get more comfortable with real world application of theoretical content and to serve as a reference.
