# Linked Lists

## Description

I need/want more practice with linked lists. Any practice problems I work on indepedently will be stored here for reference.

Some other singly-linked list problems are schoolwork found [here](https://github.com/RLewis11769/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x12-singly_linked_lists) and [here](https://github.com/RLewis11769/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x13-more_singly_linked_lists).

Additionally, some sorting algorithms, mandatory and advanced, use linked lists, single or double, as seen [here](https://github.com/RLewis11769/sorting_algorithms). Mandatory problems were a partner project with [Adam Taylor](https://github.com/tayloradam1999).

## Navigation

### linkedList.h
- Header including:
	- struct definition
	- Creation of new node in list function
	- Creation of list from array function
	- Add node to beginning of linked list function
	- Printing function
	- Freeing function

### deleteNtoLast.c
- Practice problem to delete Nth to last node
	- Last node is first last aka 1 - NOT starting at 0, using index, etc.

### findLoopNode.c
- Practice problem to find node that starts loop using Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm

### recursiveReverse.c
- Practice problem to recursively reverse a linked list

### swapNodesInPairs.c
- Practice problem to swap nodes in pairs
	- Starting at second/third node
	- First node is left alone - I should fix this/write new function
