# Data Structures

## Description

I am not entirely comfortable with certain concepts / data structures so this will be where I store practice problems.

All problems will be in C, will use an included header file, and will feature no memory leaks.

## Navigation

### Binary Trees

- array_to_binary.c
- print_tree_rep.c

### Linked Lists

- deleteNtoLast.c
- findLoopNode.c
- recursiveReverse.c
- swapNodesInPairs.c

## Usage

All files should be standalone. Because they will be in C, they can be compiled on the command line with:

```
gcc filename.c
```

I personally appreciate the options:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic filename.c
```

To confirm the presence of zero memory leaks on the executable file:

```
valgrind ./a.out
```
