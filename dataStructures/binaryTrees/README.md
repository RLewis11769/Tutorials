# Binary Trees

## Description

I need/want more practice with binary trees. Any practice problems I work on indepedently will be stored here for reference.

Some other binary tree problems are schoolwork, mandatory and advanced, found [here](https://github.com/RLewis11769/binary_trees). Mandatory problems were a partner project with [Jay Calhoun](https://github.com/Valinor13).
