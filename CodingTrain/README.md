# Coding Train

## Description

The Coding Train (on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain)) typically uses the p5.js library to visualize code. Because it uses a prebuilt library by default, the found is not executable outside of the p5.js Web Editor and must be copied over.

Basic code is primarily not original except where otherwise noted. The point is just to get more practice with JavaScript syntax in a visual and therefore easily-understandable manner.

## Navigation

### Bubbles
- Requires p5.js Web Editor
- JavaScript basics in a visual format
##### filledCircleLoop.js
    - Basic program to remind myself of the infinite nature of draw()
    - Pretty idk
##### bubblePop_Game.js
    - Playing around with classes
    - A game
        - Can you pop all the bubbles? If you miss, a new one appears!
        - Rules: Delete all the bubbles idk
        - The either/or logic for deleting or creating bubbles is mine (aka the game part)
        - Some of the color-changing logic is mine. It was surprisingly difficult and I'm taking credit

## Usage

Copy code into p5.js Web Editor [here](https://editor.p5js.org/).
