# Coding Train

## Description

The Coding Train (on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) typically uses the p5.js library to visualize code. Because it uses a prebuilt library, code is not executable where p5 library does not exist (i.e. in the terminal or any JavaScript visualizers).

Code is primarily not original except where otherwise noted. The point is just to get more practice with JavaScript tools in a visual and therefore easily-understandable manner.

## Usage

Copy code into p5.js Web Editor [here](https://editor.p5js.org/).
