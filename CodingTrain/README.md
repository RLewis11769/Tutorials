# Coding Train

## Description

The Coding Train (on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain)) is a YouTube JavaScript instructor whose teaching style I appreciate.

Some files use vanilla JavaScript. They range in subject but primarily cover DOM manipulation and APIs. The point of these files is simply to get more practice with JavaScript and experiment with subjects and libraries not covered by school projects.

Some files use the p5.js library to visualize code. Because these files use a prebuilt library by default, the code is not executable outside of the [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) and must be copied over. The point of these files is to get more practice with JavaScript syntax in a visual and therefore easily-understandable manner.

Basic code is not original except where otherwise noted. The point is just to get more comfortable with JavaScript and to serve as a reference.
