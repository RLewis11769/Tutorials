# P5.js

## Description

Playing around with APIs and adding to the DOM using P5.js library

## Steps

1. Fetch random word from [wordnik API](https://developer.wordnik.com/) using my specific key

2. Fetch image associated with word from [giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/) using my specific key

3. Add both picture and word to DOM

Note: I should not be sharing my API keys on the internet. They are private. But this example is not for profit or even sharing with anyone else, only my private usage, so hopefully this is fine.

## Usage

1. Copy code into [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)
2. Press "play" button
3. Continue pressing the "play" button to load new images
